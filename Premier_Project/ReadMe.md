# Premier Project

## Multi-Collinearity Group

### Data Science/ Data Engineering Track

This is the premier project of the multi-collinearity group in the Hamoye Summer'22 Internship. This project runs an analysis on 6 UEFA leagues across the 2014/2015 to 2018/2019 seasons.

DataSet Source: [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/slehkyi/extended-football-stats-for-european-leagues-xg?resource=download&select=understat_per_game.csv
)
### Leagues Analyzed:

- La Liga
- EPL
- BundesLiga
- Serie A
- Ligue 1
- RFPL

### Data Features:

**league:** League which the club belongs to.

**year:** Season start year of the match.

**h_a:** Home or away game.

**xG:** Expected goals metric, it is a statistical measure of the quality of chances created and conceded. More at understat.com

**xGA:** Expected goals against.

**npxG:** Expected goals without penalties and own goals.

**npxGA:** Expected goals against without penalties and own goals.

**deep:** Passes completed within an estimated 20 yards of goal (crosses excluded).

**deep_allowed:** Opponent passes completed within an estimated 20 yards of goal (crosses excluded).

**goals_scored:** Goals scored by team in the match.

**goals_conceded:** Goals conceded by team during the match.

**xpts:** Expected points.

**result:** Team's result at fulltime.

**date:** Date of match.

**wins:** Match win?

**draws:** Match draw?

**loses:** Match loss?

**pts:** Points obtained from the game (win:3 ; draw:1; loss:0)

**npxGD:** Difference between "for" and "against" expected goals without penalties and own goals.

**ppda_coef:** Passes allowed per defensive action in the opposition half (power of pressure).

**oppda_coef:** Opponent passes allowed per defensive action in the opposition half (power of opponent's pressure)

(More on ppda_coef and oppda_coef:
The greater the offensive pressing brought by a team, the lower the value of the ppda will be. On the contrary, a team that prefers to defend closer to the goal will have a higher PPDA, resulting from the greater number of passes allowed in the attacking half before attempting to recover the ball.)

**team:** Team.

**xG_diff:** Difference between actual goals scored and expected goals.

**xGA_diff:** Difference between actual goals missed and expected goals against.

**xpts_diff:** Difference between actual and expected points.

## Caveats:

- Analysis and the derived insights are only as accurate as the dataset would permit.
- Hamoye and the members of multi-collinearity project group bear no liabity for decisions and/ or losses resulting from actions made based on this analysis.
