(More on ppda_coef and oppda_coef:
The greater the offensive pressing brought by a team, the lower the value of the ppda will be. On the contrary, 
a team that prefers to defend closer to the goal will have a higher PPDA, resulting from the greater number of passes 
allowed in the attacking half before attempting to recover the ball.)
