## Practical Time Series Analysis & Forecast

This analysis and the models built was done for submission in response to questions posed to test knowledge gained from Stage D of the Hamoye Summer 2022 internship.


**DataSource:** The data was gotten from [this repository](https://github.com/HamoyeHQ/HDSC-Time-series-analysis-and-forecast)

**Data Description:** The archive contains 92,016 measurements of electricity data gathered between September 2010 and February 2021.

In this quiz, we explored and built time series forecasting models for measurements of electricity prices of a District given the total amount of Electricity consumed in that District from 2010 to 2021.

**Data Features**


- FullDate: Date in format yyyy-mm-dd  hh:mm:ss
- ElecPrice: Prices of electricity charged in Kw per hour
- Gas Price: power generated was done via a gas power plant, gas price is the price of gas at time-T
- SysLoad: Total Load on system or Power consumed at time-T 
Tmax: maximum temperature at time-T

## Key areas tested in this quiz:


- Resampling time series data.
- Building univariate and multivariate time series forecasting models.
- Measuring performance of various timeseries models.
